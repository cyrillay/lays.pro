      <description>Skills and random achievements  To give you an overview of what I can accomplish, here are a few examples of projects and missions I completed over the course of my carreer.
Data science Computer vision   Participated in the kaggle deep fake detection challenge : classifying genuine and fake videos (generated by a GAN) from a 500GB dataset. I processed the videos to reduce the dataset size, by first extracting a few frames per video, than performing image segmentation to extract the faces contained in the frames, which happened to contain glitches generated by the GAN.</description>

      <description>Introduction I built a simple inference API backed by the famous pretrained CNN model ResNet50. The network is 50 layers deep and can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. Currently, the API is running on the same machine hosting this website : a simple t2.micro on AWS EC2.
I am currently working on a front-end UI, which is already available at http://datascience.lays.pro.</description>
