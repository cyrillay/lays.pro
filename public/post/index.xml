      <description>Hey there, I am Cyril Lay, welcome to my website. Let me introduce myself quickly below !
I work as a software engineer contractor, specialized in data. I provide services for conceiving, creating or enhancing diverse applications and programs.
Fond of computers since my early age, I now have a degree in computer science, with a specialization in data mining. In order to learn how to use my machine learning knowledge on today&amp;rsquo;s high volumes of data, I worked as a data engineer and ML engineer for a year and a half, before starting to work independently.</description>

      <description>Here are some examples of my work, projects and missions I completed over the course of my career.
Data science Computer vision  Participated in the kaggle deep fake detection challenge : classifying genuine and fake videos (generated by a GAN) from a 500GB dataset. I processed the videos to reduce the dataset size, by first extracting a few frames per video, than performing image segmentation to extract the faces contained in the frames, which happened to contain glitches generated by the GAN.</description>
