      <description>Hey there, I am Cyril Lay, welcome to my website. Let me introduce myself quickly below !
I work as a software engineer contractor, specialized in data. I provide services for conceiving, creating or enhancing diverse applications and programs.
Fond of computers since my early age, I now have a degree in computer science, with a specialization in data mining. In order to learn how to use my machine learning knowledge on today&amp;rsquo;s high volumes of data, I worked as a data engineer and ML engineer for a year and a half, before starting to work independently.</description>

      <description>Here are some examples of my work, projects and missions I completed over the course of my career.
Data science Computer vision  Participated in the kaggle deep fake detection challenge : classifying genuine and fake videos (generated by a GAN) from a 500GB dataset. I processed the videos to reduce the dataset size, by first extracting a few frames per video, than performing image segmentation to extract the faces contained in the frames, which happened to contain glitches generated by the GAN.</description>

      <description>[DRAFT - WORK IN PROGRESS] In this kaggle competition, we will learn how to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi label classification.
Problem statement Misdiagnosis of the many diseases impacting agricultural crops can lead to misuse of chemicals leading to the emergence of resistant pathogen strains, increased input costs, and more outbreaks with significant economic loss and environmental impacts. Current disease diagnosis based on human scouting is time-consuming and expensive, and although computer-vision based models have the promise to increase efficiency, the great variance in symptoms due to age of infected tissues, genetic variations, and light conditions within trees decreases the accuracy of detection.</description>

      <description>This article is still a draft.
Introduction The goal of this project was to create a POC for a bot detection system, by using a data file containing all HTTP requests to a server. I started by browsing and skimming through a few technical and scientific papers and resources to gather knowledge on how bot detection is done when applied to HTTP logs, those resources will be linked at the bottom of this article.</description>

      <title>Building an image classification inference API in 30 minutes with deep learning</title>

      <description>Introduction I built a simple inference API backed by the famous pretrained CNN model ResNet50. The network is 50 layers deep and can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. Currently, the API is running on the same machine hosting this website : a simple t2.micro on AWS EC2. It is available at http://datascience.lays.pro.
