Hey there, I am Cyril Lay, welcome to my website. Let me introduce myself quickly below !
 
I work as a software engineer contractor, specialized in data. I provide services for conceiving, creating or enhancing diverse applications and programs.

Fond of computers since my early age, I obtained a degree in computer science, with a specialization in data mining.
In order to learn how to use my machine learning knowledge on today's high volumes of data, I worked as a data engineer and ML engineer 
for a year and a half, before starting to work independently.   
  
Although I am specialized in data and back-end systems, I can work full stack and eventually pick-up new
technologies on the go.
