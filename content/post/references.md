_"Cyril enthusiastically approaches complex problems and is able to think through them clearly. Cyril is a good listener and seeks out feedback to improve. He works well in teams and is able to explain complicated ideas succinctly to team members on the business and technical sides. I was impressed by how quickly Cyril learned and how self directed he was. Cyril was also involved in some presentations to partners and clients where he represented the company very well. Cyril is a promising machine learning engineer and I would gladly work with him again in the future."_ - Jonathan Baker, **Simudyne**

_"Cyril and I were both at GumGum together working on data-engineering and backend development. He quickly showed great aptitude and a drive for results. Eventually becoming a full time member of the team, he consistently produced results and became a key asset. I would work with him again and recommend him to any software engineering or data related role."_ - Azam Abdulkadir, **Gumgum Inc.**
