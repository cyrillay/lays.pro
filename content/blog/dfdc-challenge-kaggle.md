## [DRAFT - WORK IN PROGRESS]

* Deep fake context, GAN, dataset size challenge etc
* processing the videos
* Frame extraction
* Face recognition
* ResNext50 training
* Inference pipeline : video -> frames -> faces -> prediction over each face/frame -> average -> output

Classifying genuine and fake videos (generated by a GAN) from a 500GB dataset. I processed the videos to reduce the dataset size, by first extracting a few frames per video, than performing image segmentation to extract the faces contained in the frames, which happened to contain glitches generated by the GAN. I used fast-ai to train a CNN on those faces and managed to get a 75% accuracy by averaging the prediction on each frame of a video.
